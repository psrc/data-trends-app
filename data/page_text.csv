Modes,Overview,The Regional Transportation Plan was designed to meet the central Puget Sound region’s current transportation needs and to prepare for the future. Commute Mode share from the American Community Survey is an important tool to help track how travel is changing as the region grows.
Modes,Modes-Region,"Travel to work has been changing for decades. For years, driving alone to work had been the dominant mode of travel in the Puget Sound region. In recent years, extensive transit expansion, changes in growth patterns and enhanced Transportation Demand Management (TDM) strategies have slowly been reducing the share of driving alone to work, especially in the region's major employment centers. The COVID-19 pandemic changed travel to work rapidly and the region is still slowly re-adjusting to a ""new-normal"".<h2>Drove Alone</h2>Driving alone to work varies across the region but it continues to be the highest share of travel to work. Between 2006 and 2019, driving alone accounted for almost 70% of all work trips. The share of driving alone has been slowly dropping since 2010 and was significantly affected by the global pandemic. Although driving alone has increased since 2020 pandemic lows, it was still below 60% in 2022.<h2>Work from Home</h2> In 2022, approximately 25% of people worked from home in the region, down from pandemic highs closer to 30% but still above the regional average of around 6% pre-pandemic. <h2>Transit</h2>Use of transit to work had steadily climbed from about 7% of work trips in 2006 to almost 11% by 2019. The pandemic affected transit travel with many workers in downtown settings more able to work from home."
Modes,Modes-Race,"There are noticeable differences in the way people travel to work by Race & Ethnicity. Car ownership and single-family neighborhoods tend to lead to higher shares of driving alone to work - places that tend to have higher shares of non-Hispanic white residents living. The ability to work from home is very dependent on the type of job someone has, with many essential jobs requiring work in the workplace versus many white-collar jobs in technology and finance that allow greater flexibility in work location. Although a generalization, people of color tend to work from home less frequently than non-Hispanic white workers.<br/> <br/>The following chart compares the share of workers who use a specific mode to get to work  with their white counterparts in the region. You can select the mode of interest and the Race/Ethnicity in the drop down boxes."
Modes,Modes-AAPI,"The AAPI community is not monolithic, and the experiences of AAPI residents in the central Puget Sound region are diverse. Different factors may relate to who does and does not commute to work in specific modes. The differences for commute modes are likely, in part, due to how immigration and history has shaped different AAPI populations in this region. There is a diversity of backgrounds and circumstances, including refugees escaping very challenging situations, immigrants with highly specialized and sought-after skills, and families with  multiple generations of history in the region. Different communities under the AAPI umbrella may face different barriers and have different employment opportunities that affect the manner in which they commute for work.<br/> <br/>The following chart shows the share of workers by the ten largest AAPI populations in that given Census year who use a specific mode to get to work. You can select the mode of interest and the year of interest in the drop down boxes."
Modes,Modes-Occupation,"The are noticeable differences in the mode used to travel by different occupation types. Military members and Construction workers, whose hours and work locations are more difficult to serve via transit, tend to rely more heavily on driving alone to work. Management jobs, which tend to be located in downtown centers that are served well by transit tend to have higher shares of transit use but are also more likely to allow flexible work locations that result in higher shares of working from home. Many service jobs, which tend to pay less, have higher shares of transit usage but are still reliant on driving alone and carpooling for those who work hours that are not well served by transit service.<br/> <br/>The following chart shows the share of workers by Occupation in a given Census year by mode to get to work. You can select the mode of interest and the year of interest in the drop down boxes."
Modes,Modes-Wages,"Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the average salary by commute mode was fairly consistent across most modes. In general, lower income workers were more likely to share a ride with a friend or family member, likely to lessen the impact of the cost of owning multiple vehicles and paying to operate and maintain them. As the region's high-capacity transit system has continued expansion across the region, the average wage of people who use transit has been rising above those who drive alone, a trend likely reflective on an increase in choice transit riders who value the experience of high-capacity transit over other transit modes. One clear trend that emerged over the pandemic is that those workers at the highest income ranges are the most likely to work from home post-pandemic as highlighted in the large increase in average wage by worker in 2021 and 2022 for people working from home.<br/> <br/>The following chart shows the mean wage for workers by commute mode.
